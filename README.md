# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

The main file run_analysis_CORSON.r is my submission for the project.  Once you open the file you must set the working directory to a folder that includes the following files:
 - X_train
 - y_train
 - X_test
 - y_test
 - subject_train
 - subject_test
 - features
 
 Following that you can highlight the entire script and run it.  If you already have the packages installed you may skip those lines of code.  The script will produce three tidy
 data sets that you can view in R.  They are Total, summarystats, and sbujectmeans.  Total is the combined test and train sets.  Summarystats includes the mean and standard 
 deviation for each variable.  Subjectmeans includes the means of each variable for each subject and activity (Step 5).  
 
 Another output is the txt file that includes subjectmeans data.
